### The Waitless Waitlist
Have you ever been in a lab or recitation, where you kept raising your hand for help, but felt like you could never get help because you had to put your hand down, losing your place in line?
### TAs, I hear you. Let's leave the hustle of hand raising behind us...
Instead of having a line, why not have a PriorityQueue? That's right, we're dropping the First In First Out, and giving heap where it's due. 
### Well... what did we use?
We leveraged React.JS and Firebase for our implementation.  
### What's the process?
--> Join the Queue
Log in (or register), with ur email and hop into the virtual line. No need to give your arms the unnecessary workout while you wait.
--> Track your spot 
The queue shows your position in line. TAs will take you in based on their Compararators. They determine your priority, but you'll know exactly when your up next. 
-> Heap Delivered 
When it's your turn, you'll get the full experience before being taken off the queue. Now thats Priority Class experience!
## Challenges we ran into
As a group with limited experience in Node.js and Firebase, we had a lot of obstacles to overcome. We sought after more experienced developers, and leaned on each other for collaboration to break down complex topics. 
## Accomplishments we're proud of 
We are mostly proud of the fact that we were able to connect the backend implementation to the frontend, which was the most time consuming part. Also, given the lack of experience in this text stack as a team, we are preoud of the fact that we were able to add everything to our liking and follow through with our initial expectations.
## What we learned
We learned how to implement in Node.js and Firebase, and learned to communicate with each other to limit all merge issues.
